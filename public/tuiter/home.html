        This year, the Bruins are on fire starting the season off with a record of 38-5-4, winning 9 of their last 10
        games. Their next game will continue to test their success as they take on the Lightning, who are third in their
        division. As of now, it looks like the Bruins will have a phenomenal season, but time will tell if they can keep
        up their winning ways and avoid injuries.
